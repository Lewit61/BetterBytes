## ⚠️ Disclaimer & Precautions

> **BetterBytes is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Discord Inc.**

Using client modifications like BetterDiscord is **against Discord’s Terms of Service**, which prohibit the use of unauthorized client software. This includes:

- Modifying, adapting, or reverse engineering the official Discord client.
- Using third-party plugins or themes that alter how Discord works.

While many users choose to use client mods, it’s important to understand the **risks**:

- Your account **may be flagged or banned** if Discord detects a modified client.
- Malicious plugins from untrusted sources can **compromise your account or data**.
- Some plugins may access sensitive information like messages or tokens.

**You are fully responsible for any consequences that arise from using client modifications. Always use trusted, open-source tools — and read the code before you install it.**
